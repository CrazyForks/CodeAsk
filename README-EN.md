## üìñ Introduction

### Are you currently experiencing...:
- Your code breeds like rabbits (I SWEAR I DIDN'T TOUCH THAT FILE!)
- Previous dev was a part-time psychic ("needs optimization" ‚Üí Optimize WHAT exactly?)
- New hires resign after 3 days ("I've seen code, but this... this is ART")
- Comments saying "temporary fix" (that's been running longer than _Friends_ reruns)
- The moment you understand the mess ‚Äì congrats, you're now part of the problem

CodeAsk aims to solve the challenges developers face when dealing with complex codebases. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), CodeAsk can quickly analyze code, detect potential security vulnerabilities, assess code quality, and provide code organization and analysis reports, thereby improving development efficiency, reducing maintenance costs, and enhancing code quality.
