## üìñ Introduction

### Ever stared at legacy code and felt:
- Your code breeds like rabbits (I SWEAR I DIDN'T TOUCH THAT FILE!)
- Previous dev was a part-time psychic ("needs optimization" ‚Üí Optimize WHAT exactly?)
- New hires resign after 3 days ("I've seen code, but this... this is ART")
- Comments saying "temporary fix" (that's been running longer than _Friends_ reruns)
- The moment you understand the mess ‚Äì congrats, you're now part of the problem

### CodeAsk - How to Survive Legacy Spaghetti Code
CodeAsk is a code analysis tool powered by LLM. It provides:
- Intelligent code organization and analysis
- Security vulnerability detection
- Code quality assessment
- Other interesting code insights

Ultimately, it translates spaghetti code into plain human language, helping you quickly familiarize yourself with the codebase and create the illusion that "I can understand this legacy code." It helps newcomers inherit the legacy mess faster (and then join you in overtime until the ICU).
